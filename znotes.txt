# Database Migration POC - Current Status & Next Steps

## Working Features

### Database Connections
- MySQL: Full connectivity working in Settings tab
- Microsoft SQL Server: Connection established in Settings tab

### GUI Tabs
- Settings Tab: Database connections for both MySQL and SQL Server
- Analysis Tab: Schema analysis and migration reports working
- Data Tab: Table browsing and data management working
- Console Tab: Logging and output display working
- Migrations Tab: Basic interface working

## Partially Working Features

### Migration Tools on MySQL
- Bytebase: Full migration execution working
- Liquibase: Migration execution working
- Redgate: Migration execution working

### Web Interfaces
- Bytebase: Native web UI loads correctly
- Liquibase: Custom web page displays but corrupted
- Redgate: Custom web page displays but corrupted

## Known Issues

### Microsoft SQL Server Migration Support
- Current State: Migrations not running on SQL Server
- Root Cause: SQL Server connection requirements broke migration execution
- Impact: Tools only generate SQL scripts but do not execute migrations

### Console Output
- Issue: Too many redundant print statements
- Action Needed: Clean up console output

### Test Functions
- Status: "Run Test" functionality not working
- Can be removed from current implementation

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix SQL Server Migration Execution
Make all three tools execute actual migrations on SQL Server instead of just generating SQL scripts.

Technical work needed:
- Update SQL Server connection handling in each tool folder
- Fix SQL syntax differences between MySQL and SQL Server
- Ensure migration execution works for both databases

### 2. Fix Web Interface Display Issues
Fix corrupted display in Liquibase and Redgate web pages.

Note: Bytebase has its own web interface that works. Liquibase and Redgate use custom web pages.

### 3. Clean Up Console Output
Remove duplicate logging and standardize output format.

## Technical Background

The original version worked with MySQL only. When SQL Server support was added:
- Different connection parameters were needed
- SQL syntax differences caused issues
- Migration execution broke during the database separation attempt

## Current Architecture
- GUI Application: Single interface in gui.py
- Migration Tools: Bytebase, Liquibase, Redgate integrations
- Database Support: MySQL (working), SQL Server (connections only)
- Web Interfaces: Built into main GUI application

## Goal
Get SQL Server migration execution working so all three tools can be compared on both MySQL and SQL Server.
