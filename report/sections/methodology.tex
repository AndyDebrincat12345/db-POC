\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Testing Framework}
A comprehensive testing framework was developed using Python and tkinter to create a professional GUI application for systematic evaluation of migration tools. The framework ensures consistent, repeatable testing across all platforms.

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

\subsubsection{Performance Testing}
Each migration tool was tested using identical database schemas with the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Execution time measurement
    \item Error rate analysis
    \item Resource utilization monitoring
    \item Rollback capability testing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Workflow Analysis}
GitOps integration was evaluated through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Git repository integration testing
    \item Branch-based deployment simulation
    \item Merge conflict resolution scenarios
    \item Approval workflow assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User Experience Evaluation}
Team collaboration features were assessed via:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning curve measurement
    \item Documentation quality review
    \item Interface usability testing
    \item Support ecosystem analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection}
Performance data was collected through the custom GUI application's console logging system, providing real-time execution metrics and detailed error reporting for comprehensive analysis.
