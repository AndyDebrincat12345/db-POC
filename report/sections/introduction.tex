\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Background}
EY's technology consulting division requires a robust database migration solution to support a major client project involving complex database schema changes synchronized with Git-based version control. This proof of concept (POC) evaluates three leading migration tools to determine the optimal solution for enterprise-scale deployment.

\subsection{Business Requirements}
The selected migration tool must provide:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{GitOps Integration} - Seamless integration with Git workflows
    \item \textbf{Team Collaboration} - Support for code reviews and approval processes
    \item \textbf{Scalability} - Handle large, complex database schemas
    \item \textbf{Reliability} - Consistent, repeatable deployments across environments
    \item \textbf{Enterprise Features} - Audit trails, rollback capabilities, and compliance support
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Scope}
This evaluation encompasses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technical performance analysis
    \item Workflow integration assessment
    \item Team collaboration capabilities
    \item Implementation complexity evaluation
    \item Total cost of ownership considerations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Success Criteria}
The evaluation success is measured by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Execution performance metrics
    \item GitOps workflow compatibility
    \item Learning curve assessment
    \item Enterprise feature availability
    \item Implementation timeline feasibility
\end{itemize}
