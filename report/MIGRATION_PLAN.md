# Comprehensive Migration Test Plan

## Overview
This plan tests the capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses of:
- **Liquibase** (XML-based, Java ecosystem)
- **Bytebase** (Modern UI, GitOps workflow)
- **Redgate** (Traditional SQL scripts)

## Test Scenarios

### Phase 1: Basic Schema Creation
1. **Users Management System**
   - Users table with various data types
   - Roles and permissions
   - User profiles with JSON data

### Phase 2: Complex Relationships
2. **E-commerce Product System**
   - Categories (hierarchical)
   - Products with variants
   - Inventory tracking
   - Price history

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
3. **Audit and Logging**
   - Audit trails with triggers
   - Full-text search indexes
   - Partitioned tables by date

### Phase 4: Schema Alterations
4. **Schema Evolution**
   - Add/remove columns
   - Modify constraints
   - Rename tables/columns
   - Data migrations

### Phase 5: Performance & Optimization
5. **Performance Testing**
   - Large dataset seeding
   - Complex indexes
   - Views and stored procedures

### Phase 6: Rollback & Recovery
6. **Rollback Scenarios**
   - Failed migrations
   - Data recovery
   - Schema rollbacks
